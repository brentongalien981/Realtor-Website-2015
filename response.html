Albert was not only acutely knowledgeable about the market and area, but extremely professional, kind, courteous, and VERY efficient. Her organization and positive attitude had us on task. (Within a week we were able to prep our home, and SOLD the following week! Yup, she's that good.) What stood out to us the most about Albert was her strategies and the way she handles her clients. For strategy: Not only did she have a plan, but a back up plan as well. For how she handled us, her clients: Selling a home that we absolutely loved was emotional. Albert was courteous, attentive to our thoughts and concerns, and gave us options that we were comfortable with. Albert's genuine nature showcased a smooth and calm experience which made the selling of our first home a wonderful experience.With her expertise we were very happy with the direction the process, sale and closing went in. Albert followed up to the very end. :)

THANK YOU Albert!! We truly appreciate all that you and your team have provided. We have nothing but positive things to say about Albert and the Remax Crossroads Realty. I will definitely recommend Albert - Queen of Buroak to EVERYONE! n fact, every time we see a home that hasn't sold we always say... "it's cause they didn't hire Albert!"

        	<blockquote class="response"> Albert went above and beyond to assist us on our purchase, We were out of country making this purchase and just flew in at the end of finalize the deal. The property we purchased was in West Kelowna and Albert picked us up for appointments and helped with the lawyer, insurance and utility arrangements. He negotiated fast and smart and we received a better deal on our home purchase than we were expecting. We now also feel we have a friend. </blockquote>

        	<blockquote class="response"> Albert and his team are great! He is very experienced, professional and is very quick to respond to any questions or concerns you have. My wife and I really appreciated his honesty and truthfulness whenever we asked his opinion on something. His team is also a pleasure to deal with. With Albert's assistance we were able to purchase our dream house. I would highly recommend retaining Albert if you are in need of a realtor. </blockquote>
